# HypeTracker

Full stack web application to read data from public APIs (Twitter, Reddit) and form visualizations

## Project Goals

Show data about sneakers and statistics about the sneakerâ€™s attention / mentions on social media platforms such as Twitter, or Reddit. Learn and adopt SQL schemas and a RDBMS(MariaDB) in a full stack PHP application.

## Getting Started

1. Fork repo to local env
2. Insert SQL file into SQL db
3. Serve /public and /private file from htdocs of Apache Web server

## Relational Schema

Sneaker (sneaker_id, brand_id, name, release_date, image, price) Brand (brand_id, name, logo)
Ranking (sneaker_id, score, number_of_mentions, platform) Watchlist (member_id, sneaker_id)
Member (member_id, firstname, lastname, email, password)
